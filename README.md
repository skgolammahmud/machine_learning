Machine Learning Basics:

1. Machine Learning is a discipline in computer science where we train machines on data so that they can make predictions without explicit programming.<br>
2. A machine is trained by providing the input and output data not the logic.<br>
3. Machine learns to infer the logic based on input and output data provided.<br>
